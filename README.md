# Tic Tac Toe

This project was by Antoine Habran. It allows you to play the famous Tic Tac Toe game. X's are now the react logo in blue, and O's are the react logo in red.
The calculateWinner function was inspired from online as it's a pretty standard game with lots of thinking already made for it.

the game is available at https://nameless-anchorage-49561.herokuapp.com/.
